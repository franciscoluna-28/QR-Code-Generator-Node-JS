# QR-Code-Generator-Node-JS

As a frontend developer looking to expand my skill set and improve my software development capabilities, I am delighted to announce that I have embarked on my first full-stack development project. Although my primary expertise lies in the frontend, I am dedicated to learning and implementing advanced backend technologies such as NodeJS, TypeScript, and routing to create a robust and scalable backend for this project. 

I intend to enhance the overall performance and functionality of the backend before focusing on the frontend, where I plan to integrate visually stunning UI designs using TailwindCSS. By ensuring complete isolation between the backend and the frontend, I am committed to maintaining optimal security and maintainability of the application. I believe that this project will help me gain valuable experience and expertise in the backend development field and improve my overall software development skills.
